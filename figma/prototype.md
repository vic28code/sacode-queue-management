[Click here](https://www.figma.com/proto/I3SqsK6MvMDjZkn7mkqLnU/interfaz-kiosko?node-id=58-543&p=f&t=oxBD8jshv7nlKSfw-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=58%3A207&starting-point-node-id=58%3A543)  

The touchscreen kiosk begins with a welcome screen that invites users to tap and start the process. After this, the user selects the appropriate service area and proceeds to the turn generation options, where they can choose to create a new turn or retrieve an existing one. Depending on how the system has been configured by the administrator, the user may be required to enter personal information, such as an identification number, or they may be able to generate a turn directly without providing any data. Once the necessary steps are completed, the system generates the turn successfully and displays a confirmation screen with the turn number, estimated wait time, and a QR code for tracking, ensuring users have all the details they need to manage their queue position effectively.
