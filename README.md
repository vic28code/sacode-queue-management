# Touchscreen Queue Management System – SACODE

This repository contains the development of an interactive queue management system created as part of the **Software Engineering I** course at **ESPOL (Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral)**. The system allows users to request service turns through a touchscreen kiosk and track their status via a public display or a personal QR code.
